# Bilkent University CS 202 Assignments

Repository includes my solutions for the course Fundamental Structures of Computer Science I assignments. The course introduces the fundamentals of the computer programming with C++ programming. The memory leaks are tested with Valgrind for the
assignments. The code in the assignments are tested by using an automated test suite that includes multiple test cases on a remote server provided by Bilkent University.

## Assignments

- `Project 1` : Binary Search Tree
    - `Aim` : To implement a pointer-based BST whose keys are integers. An array of keys and its size are provided to the constructor to create the BST and it is assumed that there are no identical keys in the array.
    - `Public Member Functions` : Insert key, delete key, show the level of the key, display an inorder traversal of BST, display a postorder traversal of BST, find the maximum level at which the tree is a full binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor of given keys A 
       and B, find the path from root to a leaf node which has the maximum sum of the keys included in the path, find the level of the tree which has the maximum number of nodes to display the keys in that level from left to right.
    - `Content` : Object-oriented programming that implements all of the previously stated functions by using recursion. Linked list and queue objects are used as well.
